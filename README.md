# Project #X: Skystalker
 

## Overview

This is a bonus project of the software engineering immersive course at GA London. The assignment was to create a **react app** using data from any API of our choice. The assignment was to completed **individually** over one *weekend*. 

Using live air traffic data from the OpenSky API, my app shows the current number of airplanes above London and tries to put this into perspective by comparing it to the total number of planes in the sky above entire countries.

You can launch the game on GitHub pages [here](https://katheich.github.io/project-x/), or find the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/katheich/project-x).
